# Godot Export

GLTF/GLB first. Clean nodes. Godot-friendly materials and animation.

## When to Use

- Shipping meshes/animations to Godot 4.x
- GLB single-file props and characters
- Simple collision companions

## Pre-Flight

1. `asset-optimization` PASS
2. Apply transforms; Y-up friendly hierarchy
3. Materials metallic-roughness compatible

## Format

| Case | Format |
|------|--------|
| Default | GLB |
| Editable sidecar textures | GLTF separate |

## Settings

```
Format: GLB
+Y Up
Apply Modifiers: ON (when final)
Animation: include when needed
```

## Hierarchy

- Root empty or object named for scene root
- Avoid deep useless empties
- Keep collision meshes clearly named `COL_` / `UCX_` style

## Materials

- Principled BSDF → GLTF PBR
- Pack images or keep relative paths consistent
- Emission only where intended

## Animation

- NLA or actions exported as clips
- Name actions `AN_[Clip]`
- Root motion documented if used

## Verify in Godot

- [ ] Scale
- [ ] Import materials
- [ ] Animation libraries
- [ ] Collision shapes

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Prefer GLB unless project says otherwise
- Test import once
- Keep naming consistent with `naming-conventions.md`

### MUST NOT DO
- Rely on Blender-only shader nodes that do not export
